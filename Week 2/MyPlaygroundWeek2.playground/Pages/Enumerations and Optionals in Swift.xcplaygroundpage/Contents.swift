//: ## Part 2: Enumerations and Optionals in Swift

//:1. There are several gasoline types, 92, 95, 98, and diesel that we can use enum to model them.
/*:
 * Please declare an enum named Gasoline to model gasoline.
 
 * Every kind of gasoline has its price. Please declare a computed property named price and a method named getPrice separately in Gasoline enum that both will return different prices depending on different gasoline.Every kind of gasoline has its price. Please declare a computed property named price and a method named getPrice separately in Gasoline enum that both will return different prices depending on different gasoline.
 
 * Please establish raw values for Gasoline . The data type of raw value should be String. For example, Gasoline.oil92.rawValue should be “92”.
 
 * Please explain what enum associated value is and how it works.
 
 */

//: 2. Optional is a very special data type in Swift. Take var a: Int? = 10 for example, the value of a will be nil or Int . You should have learned how to deal with Optional.
/*:
 * People would like to have pets, but not everyone could have one. Declare a class Pet with name property and a class People with pet property which will store a Pet instance or nil. Please try to figure out what data type is suitable for these properties in Pet and People.
 
 * Please create a People instance. Use guard let to unwrap the pet property and print its name.
 
 * Please create another People instance. Use if let to unwrap the pet property and print its name.
